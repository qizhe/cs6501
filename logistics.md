### Reviews

Students are expected to read both assigned papers before each class.

- Reading: Read both assigned papers and be prepared to discuss the problem, methodology, results, and takeaways.
- Write-ups: Submit a short review covering both papers before class (each with less than 2 * 200 words). You may skip up to **five** reviews without penalty.
- Format: No strict template. If helpful, use this outline:
  1. Problem: What problem is being solved?
  2. Motivation: Why is it interesting or important?
  3. Key ideas: What are the core technical insights?
  4. Limitations: What assumptions or weaknesses stand out?
  5. Next steps: What follow-up problems or extensions make sense?
- Presenter exemption: If you present a paper in class, you do not submit the review for that class, and it does not count as a missed review.
- Academic integrity: The UVA Honor Code applies. Write in your own words; do not copy from papers, peers, or online sources.

### Class Participation

- **Attendance.** Regular attendance is expected and factors into participation.  
- **Quizzes.** Short quizzes on readings and reviews may be given; they count toward participation.  
- **Engagement.** Ask questions, share insights, and help maintain an inclusive, respectful discussion.  
- **Peer feedback.** Provide constructive feedback on your peers’ presentations and during discussion.

---

### Presentation

Each student (or small team, depending on enrollment) will be assigned one or more papers to present.

- **Preparation.** A **25–30 minute** talk covering the problem, design, methods, and results.  
- **Slides.** Send slides to the instructor **one week in advance**.  
- **Discussion.** Be ready to field questions and lead a short discussion after your talk.

### Project or Survey

Choose one of the following for your term work:
- Research project — individual or a team of two
- Survey report — individual

Topics should be closely aligned with the course (see the [schedule](schedule.html)). Consult the instructor to scope and refine your choice.

##### Research track
- State a clear problem, motivate why it matters, propose new ideas toward a solution, and demonstrate feasibility via an implementation or simulation.
- Evaluate against appropriate baselines or related work and discuss limitations.

##### Survey track
- Pick a focused problem area relevant to the course. 
- Write a structured report that motivates the problem, synthesizes and categorizes prior work, compares approaches and trade-offs, and highlights open questions and future directions.

### Checkpoints (both tracks)

1) Project proposal  
   - Length: 1–2 pages.  
   - Include: title, team (if any), problem statement and motivation, scope, key related work, and a biweekly timeline with milestones and risks.  
   - Track-specific:
     - Research: add the initial design/approach and the expected evaluation plan.
     - Survey: include a preliminary bibliography (papers you plan to cover) and a tentative outline.

2) Final report  
   - Use a conference-style format: [paper template](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2024/cfp.html).  
   - Research: introduction, motivation, background/related work, design, implementation, evaluation, discussion/limitations, and conclusion.  
   - Survey: introduction and background, structured review of existing work (organized into clear categories), comparative analysis, open problems, and conclusion.

**Deadlines**  
- Project proposal: TBD
- Final report: TBD
